Q2.
Exercise 1.7. You are given a program that includes a method M that 
executes squentially. Use Amdahl’s law to resolve the following questions.
• Suppose M accounts for 30% of the program’s execution time. 
What is the limit for the overall speedup that can be achieved on an n-processor
machine?
• Suppose M accounts for 40% of the program’s execution time. 
You hire a pro- grammer to replace M with M′, which has a k-fold speedup over M.
What value of k yields an overall speedup of 2 for the whole program?
• Suppose M′ , the parallel replacement for M , has a four-fold speedup. 
What frac- tion of the overall execution time must M account for if replacing it with 
M′ doubles the program’s speedup?
You may assume that the program, when executed sequentially, takes unit time.
Q3.
Exercise 2.1. A mutual exclusion algorithm provides r-bounded waitingif there is
a way to define a doorway such that if Dj → Dk, then CSj → CSk+r. Does the ABAB
Peterson algorithm provide r-bounded waiting for some value of r?
Q4.
Programmers at the Flaky Computer Corporation designed the protocol shown in Fig. 2.16
to achieve n-thread mutual exclusion.
For each question, either sketch a proof, or display an execution where it fails.
• Does this protocol satisfy mutual exclusion?
• Is this protocol starvation-free?
• Is this protocol deadlock-free?
• Is this protocol livelock-free?
Q5.
Explain why quiescent consistency is compositional.
